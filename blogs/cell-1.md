## Notes on _The Cell_, pages 96 to 126

- I was always super confused about this: how do sugars form those delicious hexagons?  Apparently the sugar forms a chain first, and then becomes a ring, and in normal conditions it actually alternates between the two forms.  Also I was pretty confused why there was a carbon outside of the ring and an oxygen impostor.  But it happens because the oxygen (as oxygens do) accumulates a slight negative charge, while the carbon accumulates a slight positive charge, so they're attracted to each other.  My question now is why the oxygen attaches to the end carbon instead of some other carbon (maybe because there's a double-bond with the other oxygen, so the negative charge is stronger?)  ![Relevant video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAf8WQ3koI0)

- There are two kinds of nucleotides (pyrimidines and purines).  A and G are purines while C and T are pyrimidines.  Purines are larger than pyrimidines, so A and T pair while G and C pair, so they don't make pairs which are significantly longer/shorter than others.

- nucleotide: base + sugar + phosphate

- the difference between DNA and RNA is a single (!) oxygen connected to one of the carbons in the pentose (5 carbon sugar).  small changes, huge effects

- oh my god here is the difference between the 5' and 3' end of DNA.  So the pentose has five carbons labeled 1 2 3 4 5 with number 5 being off the ring, and number 3 is one down and away from it.  The carbon 3 is linked to the phosphate group of the next base, which is linked to carbon 5.  So the 5' end is where the phosphate is

- gibbs free energy "rigoous" definition: enthalpy minus temperature times entropy

### Chapter 3: Proteins

- PROTEINS EVERYWHERE (basically)

- amino acids are directional: we start with the NH3+ end and end with the COO- end (N terminus and C terminus). they contribute a sequence NCC to the backbone of the protein which has special side chains that determine the shape, structure, function etc of the protein

- those pretty protein pictures are actually colored so purple -> red is N -> C terminus so you can follow the length of the polypeptide backbone

- proteins have hydrophobic centers and hydrophillic exteriors

- alpha helices dominate in transmembrane proteins, because the polypeptide backbone is hydrophillic and the alpha-helix shape helps it bond to itself and so it will fit inside the hydrophobic transmembrane

- i think it is absolutely incredible that the strength of your skin, nails, etc comes from the hydrogen bonds + hydrophobic "force" inside these tiny molecules collectively working together

- gene families => protein families

- elastin (protein) is naturally disordered + coiled; thus it can be stretched and the coils come out.  this give it the property of elasticity and is why your skin doesnt just tear off when you pull it and instead can return to its original position
